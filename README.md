# flutter_instagram_clone

This is an Instagram Clone App. It follows the traditional monolithic achitectural style.
It is developed in Flutter(UI) and the back-end is Firebase.
For some automation, I have integrated the back-end side of the App with Google Cloud Functions. 
To mantain the state throughout this project, I use Bloc and Cubit state management techiniques.
